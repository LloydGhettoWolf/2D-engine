2D-engine
=========

2d engine using directx9, fmod for sound and lua for scripting. Based upon Jon Harbours' engine in "Advanced 2D game dev", I made some small modifications to the fmod object and the way the engine works to remove lists of abstract types and other over-zealous oop related shenanigans.
